PIF
The PIF is represented by a list of tuples of type (string, int), to represent the token and the position
in the symbol table.
- add(token, position) - add the tuple (token, position) to the pif

Scanner
The scanner reads a given a program file, line by line. For each line it will split all the
different tokens of that line.

After we have all the tokens from a line, they need to be classified. If they are tokens from the
operators or keywords, they will be added to the PIF table with the -1 position.
If the token is a constant or identifier (using regular expressions), we first add them to the SymbolTable(ST)
and then use the position returned from the ST to add it to the PIF list.

If the scanning algorithm didn't detect any errors, the SymbolTable and the PIF will be written in an ".out" file
for the corresponding program.

If the token is not a special token, identifier or constant a lexical error will be thrown.
