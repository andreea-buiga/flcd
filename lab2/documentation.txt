The Symbol Table is implemented using a Hash Table, storing both identifiers and constants.

The hash function will sum up all the ascii codes of each character and the hash value will be
the modulo between the sum and the size of the hash table.

When you want to add an element will first check whether the element is not already in the Symbol Table.
If it already exists, return its -1, otherwise it will assign it the corresponding position in the hash table.
